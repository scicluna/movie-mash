# Movie-Mash

## Description

Movie-Mash aims to offer users comprehensive details about any film they search, enabling them to make informed decisions on whether a movie is worth their time. As our debut project at the EdX MSU Full Stack Bootcamp, this platform was crafted with dedication using vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML. Movie-Mash showcases sophisticated API calls and logic to transform basic search queries into a wealth of movie information.
